		<p style="color:white">I chose to go for a color scheme that includes colors that "fade" from purple to orange on the color wheel, including purple, pink, "grapefruit", and then orange. I picked these colors as I was looking for colors that both blend well together and give a sense of calmness and clarity. Orange has that property, and also matches with the "cinnamon" smell the site is supposed to induce. Given that the customer is a fan of blue and purple, I went with a purple-orange scheme that is not jarring, calm, and overall pleasing to look at.</p>
